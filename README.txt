This folder contains the code for the Audio Jacked project. This is an audio filter device with a touchscreen interface. 

For information on the project and its capabilities please see the Documentation Folder

For viewing the verilog and vhdl code in the project view the code folder. This folder also contains the binary .bit file which can be uploaded on a FPGA to test the project. 

For the complete project including all necessary libraries and testbenches please download the zip file in the complete project folder.

This project was built by making a Compact RISC 32 bit processor and then designing an application to run on it. More information on the Application can be found in the Application folder.

The assembly code was built using a assembler written in java. This can be found in the Assembler folder as well as more information on the instruction architecture.

This project requires a VMOD touch screen, PMOD Microphone, and Audio Jack from Digilent. The links are provided below. On a Spartan6 FPGA board the microphone should be connected to the first set of connectors and the speaker to the second.
